<p>These two functions use <code>recordPlot</code> and <code>replayPlot</code>
to record image frames and replay the animation respectively.</p>
<p>One difficulty in capturing images in R (base graphics) is that the
off-screen graphics devices cannot capture low-level plotting commands as
<strong>new</strong> image files â€“ only high-level plotting commands can produce new
image files; <code>ani.record</code> uses <code>recordPlot</code> to record
the plots when any changes are made on the current plot. For a graphical
device to be recordable, you have to call <code>dev.control('enable')</code> before
plotting.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(animation)

n = 20
x = sort(rnorm(n))
y = rnorm(n)
## set up an empty frame, then add points one by one
par(bg = &#39;white&#39;)   # ensure the background color is white
plot(x, y, type = &#39;n&#39;)

ani.record(reset = TRUE)   # clear history before recording

for (i in 1:n) {
  points(x[i], y[i], pch = 19, cex = 2)
  ani.record()   # record the current frame
}

## now we can replay it, with an appropriate pause between frames
oopts = ani.options(interval = .5)
ani.replay()

## or export the animation to an HTML page
saveHTML(ani.replay(), img.name = &#39;record_plot&#39;)

## record plots and replay immediately
saveHTML({
  dev.control(&#39;enable&#39;)   # enable recording
  par(bg = &#39;white&#39;)   # ensure the background color is white
  plot(x, y, type = &#39;n&#39;)
  for (i in 1:n) {
    points(x[i], y[i], pch = 19, cex = 2)
    ani.record(reset=TRUE, replay.cur=TRUE)   # record the current frame
